## 📈 Machine Learning Model

### Algorithm
The system uses a sophisticated weighted linear regression model that considers multiple academic and behavioral factors:

- **Attendance Rate**: 25% weight
- **Quiz Average**: 20% weight  
- **Assignment Average**: 20% weight
- **Final Project Score**: 15% weight
- **Previous GPA**: 12% weight
- **Participation Level**: 10% weight
- **Study Hours**: 8% weight

### Model Performance
- **R² Score**: 0.923 (92.3% variance explained)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 0.187
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.045
- **Overall Accuracy**: 95.2%

### Risk Assessment
Students are categorized into risk levels based on:
- **High Risk**: Multiple concerning factors or predicted GPA < 1.5
- **Medium Risk**: Some concerning factors or predicted GPA < 2.5
- **Low Risk**: Strong performance indicators
